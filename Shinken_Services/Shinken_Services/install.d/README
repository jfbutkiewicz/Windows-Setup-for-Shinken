~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable support for proxy this way 
    ex : USEPROXY=1 ./shinken.sh -i

Do not forget to declare proxy environment variables 

    export http_proxy=http://login:password@proxy:port
    export https_proxy=$http_proxy

For debian package manager you also have to declare your proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf

    Acquire::http::Proxy "http://login:password@proxy:Port";

For yum package manager you have to declare your proxy in /etc/yum.conf

    proxy=http://proxy:port/
    proxy_username=username
    proxy_password=password

Using proxy and sudo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should use -E option in order to preserve your environment variables

    export http_proxy=http://login:password@proxy:port
    export https_proxy=$http_proxy
    sudo -E -- USEPROXY=1 ./shinken.sh -i
